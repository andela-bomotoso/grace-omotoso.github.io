I am a Computer Scientist with bachelors and masters degree in Computer Science.My research interests are in the area of High Perfomance Computing, Natural Language Processing Computer Vision and Deep Learning. 
I have done quite a bit of research in some of the listed areas above and I am current taking a deep learning <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning
" target="_blank">course </a>course on  <a href="https://www.coursera.org
" target="_blank">coursera </a>. <p style="font-size: 18px;"> I have over 8 years of diverse practical IT professional experience that includes from IT Audit and Information Security, Software Dvelopment, and Computer Vision.
<a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports
" target="_blank">COVID-19 data</a>. We proposed that mitigations such as governmental actions and public responses,
forces the model parameters to become time series. In our approach, we do not need to explicitly specify the
time-dependent model parameters, instead we learn these parameters by defining them to be outputs of multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) that are connected to a larger MLP that predicts the solution to the epidemiological model.
We consider when there is a spatial structure in the model and when there is none.

I am also interested in the discovery of governing equations of reaction-diffusion models such as the FitzHugh-Nagumo
equations with nonlocal diffusion. In these models, the data-driven approach is able to detect nonlinear diffusion term
from experimental data.
