A Computer Scientist with bachelors and masters degree in Computer Science.  I have over 8 years of diverse practical IT professional experience that includes Software Development, IT Audit and Information Security, Data Analysis, and Computer Vision. See my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bukola-grace-omotoso-18003345/
 " target="_blank">linkedin profile</a> and <a href="Resume.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a>  for more details. I have a good blend of technical and soft skills. I act professionally, communicate effectively and manage stakeholders' expectations well. My research interests are in the areas of High Perfomance Computing, Natural Language Processing Computer Vision and Deep Learning. 
I have done quite a bit of research in some of the listed areas and I am currently taking a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning

<h2>Education and Research</h2>
Going  through the <a href=" https://www.mtsu.edu/programs/computer-science-ms/index.php
 " target="_blank">Computer Science Masters program</a> at the Middle Tennessee State University brought a paradigm shift to my research interest and career. I took some classes in High Performance Computing (HPC), Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP). See my  <a href="Transcript.pdf" target="_blank">Transcript</a> for more details. My HPC classes exposed me to some parallel processing techiques like the Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) model such as OpenSHMEM and one-sided. I also learnt how to distribute processes across a GPU such as CUDA. Taking those classes pushed me further to do my thesis in HPC.
