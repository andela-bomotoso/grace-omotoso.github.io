I am a Computer Scientist with bachelors and masters degree in Computer Science. My research interests are in the areas of High Perfomance Computing, Natural Language Processing Computer Vision and Deep Learning. 
I have done quite a bit of research in some of the listed areas and I am currently taking a deep learning <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning
" target="_blank">course </a>course on  <a href="https://www.coursera.org

I am also interested in the discovery of governing equations of reaction-diffusion models such as the FitzHugh-Nagumo
equations with nonlocal diffusion. In these models, the data-driven approach is able to detect nonlinear diffusion term
from experimental data.
